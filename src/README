Nutrient is an indexed key-value store implemented using a crit-bit trie (aka a
PATRICIA tree). 

Features:

    Stores keys and values in a single mmap()-able file, ala CDB.

    Several keys can point to the same value.

    All keys starting with a particular prefix may be iterated over.

    Nutrient enforces key uniqueness, no duplicates.

Acknowledgements:

    The crit-bit tree implementation is in large part taken from Adam Langley's
    re-formating of Dan Bernstein's original qhasm code.
