A nutrient DB file consists of two sections, a leading bitmap and a trailing
data section. A nutrient DB file must be a multiple of 128 bytes in total size
(and a minimum of 256 bytes).

The size of the bitmap (in bytes) is total_db_size / 128 / 8, so for a 4GB
(4,000,000,000 bytes) DB file, the bitmap is 3,906,250 bytes in size. This
bitmap appears at the start of the file. 

Bits set to 1 in the bitmap indicate that a 128-byte "block" in the DB file has
been allocated. Bits set to 0 indicate unallocated bits available for use. 

The remainder of the DB file is for mixed use by the critbit datastructures and
values. The first block immediately following the bitmap is the root of the
critbit tree.
